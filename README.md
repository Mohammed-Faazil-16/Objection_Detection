Here's a sample README file content for your project. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, usage, and any dependencies.

Object Detection with MobileNet SSD
This project demonstrates object detection using the MobileNet SSD model with OpenCV. The model identifies and labels objects within an image based on a pre-trained network.

Project Overview
The project uses the MobileNet SSD model to detect objects in an image. The model is trained on the VOC dataset and can recognize various classes such as "dog," "cat," "car," and more. The project uses OpenCV's deep learning module to load the model, perform detection, and annotate the detected objects in the image.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV library
You can install OpenCV using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Mohammed-Faazil-16/Objection_Detection.git
cd object-detection-mobilenet-ssd
Download Model Files

Download the MobileNet SSD model files:

Prototxt File: MobileNetSSD_deploy.prototxt
Caffemodel File: MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel
Place these files in the model directory.

Image File

Add an image to be processed in the images directory. Ensure the image is named room_people.png or update the script to match the image file name.

Usage
Run the script to perform object detection:

sh
Copy code
python object_detection.py
Script Details
image_path: Path to the image file for object detection.
prototxt_path: Path to the MobileNet SSD model prototxt file.
model_path: Path to the MobileNet SSD model caffemodel file.
min_confidence: Minimum confidence threshold for detected objects.
The script will read the image, perform object detection, and display the annotated image with bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.
